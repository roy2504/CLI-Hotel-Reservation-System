# Hotel Reservation System

This marks my inaugural project during my initial year in college. The project involves the creation of a straightforward command-line Hotel Reservation System.

The core functionality of this system revolves around enabling users to make reservations for various room types, such as Queen-sized bedrooms or King-sized bedrooms. Users can choose from a pool of available rooms, whether they are already booked or unbooked. Addionally, it also allows to view to booked
rooms and delete reservation bookings. 

This project has made me understand the concept of single responsibility and why that is so crucial in development.

The implementation of this project utilizes the C programming language. The code delves into the concepts of arrays and file handling to execute the Hotel Reservation System effectively.
